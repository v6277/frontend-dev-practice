# frontend-dev-practice
A practice repo following the [Front-End Web Development: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (1st ed)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/front-end-web-development-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide/) book as a guide.

###### Tools used
The book recommends using specific tools (Google Chrome, Windows or MacOS, Atom, etc) to follow the guided coding practices more easily, but this repo was built and tested on alternative options. These are:

*Solus (Linux operating system)
*Mozilla Firefox
*Visual Studio Code (with plugins)
*Latest git with Gnome Terminal
*Node.js
